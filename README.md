# Eaglrcraft
Note: we will be transitioning away from Eaglercraft being standalone 'free browser minecraft' to Eaglercraft being a bukkit/bungee plugin for servers to allow 'online access' to players who register with a command as their real online-mode Minecraft account on the server. Server owners can still elect to set online-mode=false in their server.properties to allow free login but now that's their legal screw up instead of mine.
