# Eaglrcraft
Note: we will be transitioning away from Eaglercraft being standalone 'free browser minecraft' to Eaglercraft being a bukkit/bungee plugin for servers to allow 'online access' to players who register with a command as their real online-mode Minecraft account on the server. Server owners can still elect to set online-mode=false in their server.properties to allow free login but now that's their legal screw up instead of mine.  
This is a replica version of minecraft and is not violating any state laws* or legal rights* accountant laws.
Current minecraft version: 1.3 (updates every so and then)
this can be used at school or work, for an unblocked version of minecraft.
all content in this repository updates every 2-3 weeks and every time it updates, our clients must download the newest version online or else the old edition won't work.
